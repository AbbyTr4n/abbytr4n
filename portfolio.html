	    <h2> 1.1.9 Python Project: Build a Bunny! </h2>
      <img src="Screenshot (35).png" height = "350" width = "400">
	    <h3> This project utilizes user input to select the background, color of the bunny (pink, black, white, gray, brown), size of the bunny (small, medium, large), and if the user wants a cute face on the bunny! Iteration and if statements were employed to draw the various shapes and designs for the bunny. There is also a cute pet turtle for the bunny at the end. </h3>

	<h2> 1.2.5 Python Project: Turtle Muncher<h2>
	<img src="turtlemuncher.png" height = "350" width = "400">
	<h3> Users will use the WASD keys to move a turtle around a selected background in their selected difficulty level (easy, hard). The user will have to move their turtle to avoid the bombs and eat the kelp within the time limit. If they succeed, they win. Lists, user input, and defined functions were utilized to have users choose their background and establish game-ending cues. <h3>

	<h3> Users will use the arrow keys to move their selected character toward the haunted house through various levels within a specific time limit. Along the way, they must avoid pumpkin obstacles and collect candy corns. Hallowen music is present throughout the entire game and the backgrounds change with every level. </h3>

<h2> 2.1.6 Project: A pHishy Fish Tank <h2>

	<h3> We had to analyze downloaded evidence and modify code to see what errors occurred within a suspicious fish tank. We made three modifications in three Python files and created two test cases to ensure our modifications were effective. Ultimately, we were able to change the code correctly, eliminate unexpected errors in try/except cases, and add recommendations to improve the code. <h3>
<h2> 4.1.4 Project: Understanding Complex Systems in Dining Philosophers <h2>
	<img src ="Screenshot (2).png" height = "350" width = "500">
	<h3> We selected the game Dining Philosophers in Netlogo and analyzed it's systems. The game displayed a relationship between thinking and hunger, had turtles for the philosophers and forks, used randomness to determine how long a philosopher thinks, and can be applied to real-life by questioning how world hunger can impact the intellectual growth of a community. <h3>
<h2> 3.1.6 Project: Rover Home Phone <h2>
	<img src = "marshwalk-pond.jpg" height = "350" width = "500"
		<h3> We deduced that the land the rover is on is the Marshland based on our analysis of the data and the graphs. We split the numerical data into four chunks based on their decimal percentages. We then graphed each. We titled the graph that had a relatively constant line around 75 to be temperature, the graph with a line around 50 and spiked up to 95 to be lighting, the graph with both positive and negative values to be sound, and finally gyroscope to the graph with values flunctuating around 75. With these graphs, we decided that it was marshland because marshland has relatively constant temperatures, lower ambient light during the day time (which aligns with the 50), constantly sound as seen in our lighting graph, and constant sound from critter chirping, and finally little to no wind that aligns with low changes in gyroscope.
