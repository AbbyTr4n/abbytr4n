      <img src="Screenshot (35).png" height = "350" width = "400">
	    <h3> This project utilizes user input to select the background, color of the bunny (pink, black, white, gray, brown), size of the bunny (small, medium, large), and if the user wants a cute face on the bunny! Iteration and if statements were employed to draw the various shapes and designs for the bunny. There is also a cute pet turtle for the bunny at the end. </h3>

	<h2> 1.2.5 Python Project: Turtle Muncher<h2>
	<img src="turtlemuncher.png" height = "350" width = "400">
	<h3> Users will use the WASD keys to move a turtle around a selected background in their selected difficulty level (easy, hard). The user will have to move their turtle to avoid the bombs and eat the kelp within the time limit. If they succeed, they win. Lists, user input, and defined functions were utilized to have users choose their background and establish game-ending cues. <h3>

	<h3> Users will use the arrow keys to move their selected character toward the haunted house through various levels within a specific time limit. Along the way, they must avoid pumpkin obstacles and collect candy corns. Hallowen music is present throughout the entire game and the backgrounds change with every level. </h3>

	<h3> We had to analyze downloaded evidence and modify code to see what errors occurred within a suspicious fish tank. We made three modifications in three Python files and created two test cases to ensure our modifications were effective. Ultimately, we were able to change the code correctly, eliminate unexpected errors in try/except cases, and add recommendations to improve the code. <h3>
